Feature: Wiki layouting and many page parts
  In order to have structured pages on wiki
  A user
  Should be able to define layout and edit page parts

  Scenario: User creates a page with header and pewe layout
    When I go to the main page
    And I login as "johno"
    And I fill in "title" with "Root page"
    And I fill in "body" with "Root body!"
    And I fill in "summary" with "A change"
    And I select "PeWe Layout" from "layout"
    And I press "Create"
    When I follow "edit"
    And I fill in "new_page_part_name" with "navigation"
